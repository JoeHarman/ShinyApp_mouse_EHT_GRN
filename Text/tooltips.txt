# 1 grn_centrality - degree
Number of connections to a node
# 2 grn_centrality - betweenness
Frequency at which a node is part of a shortest path between two other nodes. High values indicate bottlenecks 
# 3 grn_centrality - closeness
The average length of shortest paths from a node to each other node 
# 4 grn_centrality - eigenvector
Node influence measure. High scores reflect nodes that are connected to many high scoring nodes 
# 5 grn_centrality - hub_score
Kleinbergs hub score. Hub score is equal to the sum of authority scores of nodes it points towards. High scores reflect nodes that connect to high authority targets
# 6 grn_centrality - authority_score
Kleinbergs authority score. Authority is equal to the sum of hub scores that point towards it. High scores reflect highly regulated targets
# 7 top_n_centrality
Number of most-central nodes to plot
# 8 grn_subset - Full
Full network
# 9 grn_subset - RNA1
Transient HE/pro-HSC depleted
# 10 grn_subset - RNA2
Endothelial expression
# 11 grn_subset - RNA3
Transient HE/pro-HSC enriched
# 12 grn_subset - RNA4
Early haematopoietic specification (upregulated in pro-HSC)
# 13 grn_subset - RNA5
late haematopoietic specification (upregulated in pre-HSC I/II)
# 14 grn_tf
Plot only TF nodes? (ignored for Central TFs mode)
# 15 grn_mode - Central TFs
Plot most central TF nodes of network
# 16 grn_mode - Upstream
Plot all upstream regulators of reference node
# 17 grn_mode - Downstream
Plot all downstream targets of reference node
# 18 makeGRN
Plot network. Click this to execute selected settings
# 19 ATAC_topn / RNA_topn
Select top-variable genes as input for PCA analysis. Lower is quicker, but may restrict gene loading visualisation.
# 20 TF_A
Select a TF for cooperation results. TF A also controls top-cooperation plots.
# 21 TF_B
Select a TF for cooperation results.
